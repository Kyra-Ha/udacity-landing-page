# Landing Page Project

## Overview

Practice in developing an interactive landing screen through manipulating the DOM by:

* Creating a dynamic navigation bar that automatically updates when new content is added
* Adding an auto-scroll feature when clicking desired section of menu
* When section is in view, active state shows background CSS animation

## Note 

I developed all of the JavaScript--the CSS was all made by Udacity.
